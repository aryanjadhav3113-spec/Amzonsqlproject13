This SQL program creates a **teslacompany database** with an **employees table** containing employee names, departments, and salaries. It inserts employee data, deletes records from the **HR department**, adds new employees, then uses **TRUNCATE** to remove all data. Finally, it reinserts one new employee and displays the updated table.
